        <p>A web application where users are able to log in as admins and build their own website using in app tools. No tech skills are needed on the part of the user. 
            Though originally implemented to allow small companies to maintain their own website over time without a software team,
          the codebase can be used to allow content creators easier access to site-building. </p><br>

      <h3> How I became a full stack developer </h3>
      <p> I started by researching python and initially took the backend path by developing my first API.
      Later, I was able to build and deploy a Flask website hosted on a UNIX based Amazon Web Services instance. I learned how to move data from end to end and represent it dynamically on the front end using javascript.
      Though being self-taught was a beneficial experience, I wanted to be able to certify myself as a web developer and talk about code with others.
      That's when I decided to enroll in CodingDojo's bootcamp. I graduated from the program, learning how to build websites using 3 different full stacks: Django, ASP.NET Core, 
      and MEAN. I currently specialize in the development and hosting of full stack web applications. Click anywhere on the water to feed the fish.</p>

      <p> Languages: C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python </p>
      <p> Frameworks: Angular, ASP.NET Core, NodeJS, Django, Flask, Entity Framework ORM, Mongoose </p>
      <p> Databases: MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB </p>
      <p> Hosting: AWS, Ubuntu, Linux </p>
